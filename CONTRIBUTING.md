# Contributing to KitPvP Framework

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the KitPvP Framework!

There are not many guidelines, all the help I can get is appreciated, but the few guidelines I do have is the following.

### Code must be creditted

If you want to add code that is not yours, please credit the original authors of the code!

### Code must work

The code must be tested in-game and is sure to be functional.

### No malicious code

Code should not be malicious. Such as stealing IPs, granting OP to users, etc.

# Notice

This will be updated every so often when I think of more guidelines, or edit existing guidelines. So please check this
before you attempt to commit or think of committing to this project.
